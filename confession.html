      <h1>To My Sania, With All My Heart 💖</h1>
      <p class="sub">A love story from my soul, for you...</p>

      <div class="confession-box">
        <p>
          💌 It all started with that one call. The night you cried for the
          first time, the night I heard the raw, unspoken words of your heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 I heard you tell me how much I meant to you, how much you loved me,
          and I felt like I was in a dream, one that I had never dared to dream
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 In that moment, I realized how deeply I had fallen for you, but
          also how much I had been taking you for granted. I wasn’t prepared for
          the love that was pouring from your heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 The guilt hit me hard — how could I have not seen this before? How
          could I have waited so long to understand just how much you meant to
          me?
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 In an instant, I made a decision that would change everything. I
          booked a flight to Mumbai. Without thinking twice, without hesitation.
          Because I knew if I didn’t get to you, I would lose you forever. I
          wasn’t willing to lose my heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 Arriving in Mumbai, I was overwhelmed with emotion. I didn’t know
          what to expect, but I knew one thing — I had to hold on to you. And
          when I saw you, standing there with your eyes full of both strength
          and vulnerability, I knew I had made the right choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 But the real weight hit me the night before you left for the UK.
          The heaviness of it all — the thought of being far away from you, the
          thought of not being able to touch your hand, to laugh with you, to
          live with you every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 I tried to stay strong, to hold back my tears. I told myself,
          'You’re a strong boy, Nitin. Don’t cry.' But it was impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 That moment, when I held your hand in that cab, I broke down. The
          dam of emotions, which I had been trying to hold back for so long,
          came rushing out. I couldn’t hold it anymore. I cried. I whispered to
          you, 'I love you, Sania. I can’t lose you. You are my world.'
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 It felt like time had stopped in that moment. I had never been more
          sure of anything in my life — that you were the one I wanted to spend
          the rest of my life with.
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 You are the reason I wake up every day with hope. You are the
          reason I smile for no reason, and you are the reason I keep pushing
          myself to be the best version of myself. The way you love me, the way
          you make me feel, is beyond anything I could have ever imagined.
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 Even though we're miles apart, this distance doesn't feel like
          distance at all. The love we share is so deep that nothing can
          separate us — not time, not space. It's like we are always together in
          our hearts, no matter where we are.
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 Every day, I dream of the life we will build together. I work
          harder, I strive to be better, because you deserve the best. I want to
          give you everything you have ever dreamed of, and more. I want to live
          a life filled with laughter, with adventures, and with love — just the
          two of us, always.
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 Sania, I don’t have the words to describe the impact you’ve made in
          my life. Every single day, my love for you grows deeper, stronger,
          more beautiful. You make me believe in love, in destiny, in the beauty
          of everything that is yet to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 You waited for me, loved me without hesitation, and now I promise
          you, from every part of my soul, that I will never let you go. I will
          never take you for granted again. I will love you with everything I
          have, for the rest of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          💌 Thank you for making me yours. Thank you for being the most
          incredible person I have ever known. Thank you for making me feel like
          the luckiest person alive.
        </p>
        <p>❤️ I love you, Sania. With all my heart, forever and always. ❤️</p>
